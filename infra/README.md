# OpenDXP-on-Coolify Bootstrap (OpenTofu)

One-shot provisioning of the production **and** staging OpenDXP 6 stack on Coolify v4,
driven by a single command: **`ddev coolify-bootstrap up`**.

**The contract:** `infra/` sets up your environment **once**. After bootstrap the
**Coolify UI is the single source of truth** — maintain, tune and upgrade the running
environment there. Never re-run the bootstrap against a live environment: the Coolify
provider pushes env vars **write-only** (re-sent on every apply; changes made in the UI
are invisible to it), so a re-apply silently overwrites whatever was changed in the UI
since. The command enforces this with guardrails (see Step 2).

Under the hood: OpenTofu + the external
[`vanWittlaer/terraform-coolify-shopware-stack`](https://github.com/vanWittlaer/terraform-coolify-shopware-stack)
module (pinned via `source = "...?ref=vX.Y.Z"` in `main.tf`, instantiated once per
environment). The provider/Coolify quirks worked around along the way are documented in
the module's
[FINDINGS.md](https://github.com/vanWittlaer/terraform-coolify-shopware-stack/blob/main/FINDINGS.md).

## What gets created (per environment)

| Resource | tofu type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `web` | `coolify_application_docker_image` | nginx+php-fpm on :8000, storefront domain, health check `/api/_info/health-check`, post-deploy runs the deployment-helper (install/migrate). One image for all envs; HTTP basic-auth is gated by host in the baked nginx config, with the `.htpasswd` bind-mounted where `enable_basic_auth = true` (staging) |
| `workers` | `coolify_service` (`docker_compose_raw`) | **one service, 3 containers**: `worker-1`, `worker-2` (`messenger:consume`), `scheduler` (`scheduled-task:run`) |
| `mariadb`, `redis-cache`, `redis-session` | `coolify_database_*` | DSNs read from each resource's computed `internal_db_url`; Symfony lock uses the DB |
| `rabbitmq`, `elasticsearch` | `coolify_service` (`docker_compose_raw`) | internal-only; elasticsearch per-env via `enable_elasticsearch` (on for prod + staging) |
| `mailpit` | `coolify_application_docker_image` | per-env via `enable_mailpit` (staging on, prod off → real SMTP); web UI on `mailpit_domain`, gated by `MP_UI_AUTH` (`mailpit_ui_auth`) |
| `backup` | `coolify_service` (`docker_compose_raw`) + 2× `coolify_scheduled_task` | idle `opendxp-ops-shell` sidecar, cron-`exec`'d; per-env via `enable_backup` (on for prod + staging) |

The private/public **filesystems are on S3** (`opendxp/config/packages/opendxp.yaml`); the
`S3_*` env vars are fanned out to every process, and bucket **CORS** is managed via the AWS
provider pointed at the S3 endpoint (`cors.tf`). The provider has no shared-variable
resource, so the shared env (`local.shared_env`) is fanned out per resource.

## Prerequisites

- A running **Coolify v4** instance with the **API enabled** + a token, and a **server**
  registered in it (you need its UUID).
- A **private registry** with the built `web` image. NB: `config/packages/*.yaml` (S3,
  trusted_proxies, monolog) is **baked into the image at build time** — a config change
  needs an image rebuild, not a re-provision. The build stage must be PHP 8.4
  (`opendxp/docker/Dockerfile`) to match the lock/runtime.
- **S3 buckets** already created (public bucket must serve objects **public-read**).
- **ddev running** (`ddev start`) — OpenTofu and the bootstrap command come from the
  [`ddev-coolify-opendxp`](https://github.com/vanWittlaer/ddev-coolify-opendxp) add-on
  (`ddev add-on get vanWittlaer/ddev-coolify-opendxp`); you never invoke `tofu` yourself.
  (The command it installs stays `ddev coolify-bootstrap`; only the add-on repo was renamed.)

See `PREREQUISITES.md` for the detailed walk-through.

## Step 1 — fill in the config

```bash
cd infra
cp secrets.auto.tfvars.example secrets.auto.tfvars   # fill in real values
```

### `secrets.auto.tfvars` (git-ignored)

Coolify connection (`coolify_endpoint` / `coolify_token` / `server_uuid`) plus per-env
`secrets_production` / `secrets_staging`. Coolify generates the DB/Redis passwords (consumed
via `internal_db_url`), and we set the RabbitMQ password ourselves, so the values you own are:

- `server_uuid` — the Coolify **server** each env deploys onto (an existing server's id, not a
  generated secret). Same UUID for both = co-located; different UUIDs = prod and staging split
  across servers.
- `app_secret`, `instance_id`, `rabbitmq_password` — generate once with `openssl rand -hex 16`,
  keep **stable** across deploys (distinct prod vs staging).
- `s3_access_key_id` / `s3_secret_access_key` — object-storage credentials.
- `mailer_dsn` — production SMTP DSN (defaults to `null://null`; staging ignores it and uses
  Mailpit).
- `mailpit_ui_auth` — (staging) basic-auth for the Mailpit web UI (`MP_UI_AUTH`), space-separated
  `user:password`. Empty ⇒ the UI is open — set it, since Mailpit gets a public domain.
- `s3_backup_access_key_id` / `s3_backup_secret_access_key` — backup-bucket credentials, required
  when `enable_backup = true` (Hetzner keys are project-wide, so these may equal the `s3_*` pair).

### Per-environment settings (`*.tfvars`)

Env-specific knobs live in the `production` / `staging` objects: `web_image*`, `web_domain`,
`s3`, the Symfony env controls **`app_env`** (`prod` / `stage`) / **`app_debug`** /
**`monolog_log_level`**, the infra toggles **`enable_elasticsearch`** / **`enable_mailpit`** /
**`enable_backup`** (+ the **`backup`** object: bucket, region, domain, path, schedules), and —
staging only — **`mailpit_domain`** (the Mailpit web-UI FQDN). Mail routing follows
`enable_mailpit` (staging → Mailpit, production → the secret DSN).
(`mariadb_public_port` / `rabbitmq_mgmt_port` are still literals in `main.tf` — a remaining
candidate to move into the per-env objects for uniformity.)

**Separate servers per environment.** Each env's Coolify server is its **`server_uuid` inside
the `secrets_production` / `secrets_staging` object** (git-ignored `secrets.auto.tfvars`) —
symmetric with the other per-env secrets. Point both at the same UUID to co-locate, or at
different UUIDs to run prod and staging on separate servers. One Coolify control plane (the
single `endpoint`/`token`) manages both — only the per-resource `server_uuid` differs, so no
provider aliasing is needed.

### Backup service

Scheduled backups (the module's `backup.tf`) are gated per-env by **`enable_backup`**
(like `enable_elasticsearch` — on for both prod and staging). The service is a single-container
`docker_compose_raw` running the **env-agnostic ops/maintenance sidecar image** idle on
`tail -f /dev/null`. That image is **not built here** — it lives in its own standalone repo
([`opendxp-ops-shell`](https://github.com/vanwittlaer/opendxp-ops-shell)) and is referenced by
the root-level `backup_image` / `backup_image_tag` vars (one image tag serves both environments,
e.g. `ghcr.io/vanwittlaer/opendxp-ops-shell:latest` — pin a released `vX.Y.Z` for production).

Coolify **Scheduled Tasks** `exec` the two backup scripts into that running container on cron:
`backup-db` (`bin/backup-db.sh`, DB dump via `opendxp-cli project dump`) and `backup-s3`
(`bin/backup-s3.sh`, offsite S3 mirror). Default schedules are `0 2 * * *` / `30 2 * * *`
(staggered so the S3 mirror runs after the DB dump); override per env via **`backup.db_schedule`**
/ **`backup.s3_schedule`** in `production.tfvars` / `staging.tfvars`.

The backup bucket is a **separate bucket** (`opendxp-backup`). *Ideally* it would sit at a
different, offsite location than the source buckets — but the current tfvars point it at
**`hel1`**, the same object-storage location as the source (that's the only Hetzner location in
use here). So it protects against accidental deletion (separate bucket + rclone soft-deletes)
but **not** a location-wide outage; set `backup.s3_backup_region` / `s3_backup_domain` to a
different location if you have one. Its credentials (`s3_backup_access_key_id` /
`s3_backup_secret_access_key`) are **secrets** in the git-ignored `secrets.auto.tfvars`, not in
`*.tfvars` (Hetzner keys are project-wide, so they can be the same pair as `s3_*`).

## Step 2 — bootstrap

```bash
ddev coolify-bootstrap up
```

The command (a ddev web command, `.ddev/commands/web/coolify-bootstrap`) runs: prereq checks
(config files present, Coolify API reachable with your token) → `tofu init/validate/plan` →
shows the plan → **one** confirmation → apply → prints the post-bootstrap checklist and the
hand-off message.

Guardrails:

- **No local state, but the Coolify project already exists** → it **refuses**: that
  environment is live and UI-managed; bootstrapping again would create a duplicate stack.
- **Local state present** (already bootstrapped from this machine) → it **warns** that a
  re-apply overwrites UI-made env changes and asks for explicit confirmation. This is an
  escape hatch for a botched first run — not a maintenance path.

## Step 3 — post-bootstrap checklist (one-time manual steps)

Printed by the command after a successful apply; also listed here. On each Coolify host:

- **`chown` the log dir** so the container user (UID 82) can write:
  `mkdir -p /data/opendxp/<env>/var/log && chown -R 82:82 /data/opendxp/<env>/var/log`.
- **Staging basic-auth `.htpasswd`** — the single web image gates HTTP basic-auth by host
  (`$auth_host_gate` in `opendxp/docker/nginx/basic-auth.conf` lists the staging FQDN); on a
  gated host nginx reads `/var/www/auth/.htpasswd` from a host bind mount (`basic_auth_host_path`,
  wired in `main.tf` to `<log_host_base>/staging/auth`, provisioned when `enable_basic_auth = true`).
  Create it on the host so the hash never enters the repo/image:
  `mkdir -p /data/opendxp/staging/auth && htpasswd -nbB <user> '<pw>' > /data/opendxp/staging/auth/.htpasswd && chown -R 82:82 /data/opendxp/staging/auth`.
- **DB tuning** (`mariadb_conf` / `redis_conf`) is disabled in the module — Coolify 4.1.2
  rejects the provider's extended-fields update; set `my.cnf` / `redis.conf` in the Coolify UI.
- **Build the ES indices** in every environment where `enable_elasticsearch = true`: after the
  deploy that wires Elasticsearch, run `bin/console es:index` (storefront) and
  `bin/console es:admin:index` (admin search), and redeploy the workers so they pick up the ES
  env. Until built, search falls back to the DB (`SHOPWARE_ES_THROW_EXCEPTION=0`), so nothing
  500s in the meantime.

`connect_to_docker_network` (rabbitmq + workers + elasticsearch + backup reaching the shared
network) is handled automatically by `null_resource`s (the provider can't round-trip the flag).

## Step 4 — hand off to the Coolify UI

From here on the **Coolify UI owns the environment**:

- **Archive** `secrets.auto.tfvars` and `tofu.tfstate` off-machine (password manager / vault)
  and delete them locally — see `STATE.md`. They are recovery records, not living artifacts.
- **Env changes** happen in the Coolify UI and take effect at the next redeploy (Coolify
  injects env at deploy time).
- **Stack upgrades** (module changes, new services): new setups simply bootstrap the latest
  version; changes to a *running* shop are applied manually via the Coolify UI, following the
  module's release notes.

## Teardown (trial runs)

```bash
ddev coolify-bootstrap destroy
```

Only possible while the local state from `up` still exists. Coolify may leave orphaned
containers behind (they keep Traefik labels and can keep serving a domain); remove them on the
host with `docker rm -f` — see the module's FINDINGS.md.

## Appendix — under the hood

For working on this stack itself (not for maintaining a bootstrapped environment). Run inside
the web container (`ddev ssh`, then `cd infra`):

```bash
tofu init
tofu fmt -recursive && tofu validate
tofu plan    -var-file=production.tfvars -var-file=staging.tfvars
tofu apply   -var-file=production.tfvars -var-file=staging.tfvars   # what "up" runs
tofu destroy -var-file=production.tfvars -var-file=staging.tfvars   # what "destroy" runs
```

- Env vars written by tofu land in Coolify's config; Coolify injects them at **(re)deploy**
  time — pair any env change with a redeploy of the affected `web` app / `workers` service
  (Coolify UI **Redeploy**, or `POST /api/v1/deploy?uuid=…&force=true`). The
  `coolify_envs_bulk` vars are **write-only** to the provider (re-pushed every apply, no drift
  detection) — this is exactly why re-applying against a UI-managed environment is forbidden.
- The Coolify provider has **no `entrypoint` argument** for image apps — workers use
  `start_command`; see the module's FINDINGS.md ("Risk W") if a worker boots the web server
  instead of `messenger:consume`.
- State: a local file, `tofu.tfstate` — see `STATE.md` for the archive/recovery model.
